# Html5Template
This repository contains source codes for html5 template.
# Motivation
This template was created by building a web site, where I used the resources retrieved from the web and codes created by myself.
I decided to put together the major components of the layout and create a basic structure, which can also be used for other sites.
# Installation
You could run this template, using any browser.
# Description of template
